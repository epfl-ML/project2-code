# Data extraction

In order to process the `.smo` files and transform them to `.csv` files, we implemented a Kotlin program which can be
used to extract the data. The program is located in the `/data-extraction-kotlin` folder, and the instructions to run it
can be found [here](data-extraction-kotlin/README.md).

An equivalent (but less feature-rich) Python program is also available in the `/data-extraction-python` folder.

For simplicity, we already pre-processed the data necessary to run the experiments, and you can find instructions to
obtain it in the [`../data/README.md`](../data) file.
